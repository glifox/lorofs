# LoroFS

_LoroFS_ is a file system for the web built using [Loro](https://github.com/loro-dev), designed to be local-first and support collaborative editing. It focuses on managing the file structure and metadata, while giving the user full control over the actual file content. This approach prevents the main LoroDoc from becoming excessively large and slow.

_LoroFS_ also provides an integrated file explorer component to efficiently interact with and visualize the file system in the **DOM**.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @glifox/lorofs
```

See the [sample](./sample/index.ts) for complete implementation example.
